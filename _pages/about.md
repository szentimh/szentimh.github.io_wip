I am a machine learning software developer who is curious about how machines understand the world around us and how they impact society. I recently completed 
my Master of Applied Science in Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My research involved using machine vision for congestion management
in FPGA placement, which is a chip containing reconfigurable hardware, as well as integrating machine learning models into existing FPGA placement software. I'm
currently expanding my knowledge in the machine learning field.
